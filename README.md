# Capstone

# Hi! Welcome to my first repository

Here, I'd like to share my project from the data science bootcamp learning in Purwadhika

# Commodity Trading - Mini Python Application
This is a Python-based mini project developed during my time in the Data Science Bootcamp at Purwadhika. The goal of this project is to simulate basic operations in commodity trading, giving users an interactive way to manage virtual assets while practicing Python programming fundamentals.

This application allows users to do activities in commodity trading, including: 
1. Read the commodity watchlist
   View the list of available commodities for trading
2. Delete commodity watchlist
   Remove a commodity from the watchlist, except for the essential items
3. Read the user's portfolio and trading balance
   Check your owned assets and current balance in real-time
4. Buy a commodity
   Purchase new commodities or increase your holdings in existing ones
5. Processing/refining Commodity
   Convert raw commodities into value-added products for greater profits
6. Sell commodity/product
   Execute sales transactions to earn from your holdings

This project showcases the practical implementation of:
- Data collection using lists and dictionaries
- Logical operations with conditional statements
- Repetitive tasks using loops
- Modularization with custom functions
- Simulating real-world business logic with simple Python constructs

# Final Notes
This project is part of my portfolio as I continue building expertise in data science and programming. You‚Äôre welcome to explore the code, leave feedback, or share your thoughts!
Terimakasih, and have a great day! üôè
