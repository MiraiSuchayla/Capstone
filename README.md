# Capstone

# Hi! Welcome to my first repository

Here, I'd like to share my project from the data science bootcamp learning in Purwadhika

1. Commodity Trading
This application allows users to do activities in commodity trading, including: 
- Read commodity watchlist
- Delete commodity watchlist
- Read the user's portfolio and trading balance
- Add existing/buy new commodity to their portfolio
- Processing raw commodity materials into an end product to earn bigger profits
- Sell commodity/product

With this application, a writer could practically present mini applications through the Python language with data collection, conditional statements, looping, regular functions, etc.

You are pleased to come and take a look at my portfolio,
Terimakasih, and have a good day!
