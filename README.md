# CommodityTrading

# Hi! Welcome to my first repository
Here, I'd like to share one of my projects developed during the Purwadhika Digital School‚Äôs Data Science and Machine Learning Course. This is a mini application built using Python, designed to simulate simple yet insightful activities in commodity trading

# Commodity Trading - Mini Python Application
This Python-based mini project is to simulate basic operations in commodity trading, giving users an interactive way to manage virtual assets while practicing Python programming fundamentals.

This application allows users to do activities in commodity trading, including: 
1. Read the commodity watchlist:

   View the list of available commodities for trading
   
3. Delete commodity watchlist:

   Remove a commodity from the watchlist, except for the essential items
   
5. Read the user's portfolio and trading balance:

   Check your owned assets and current balance in real-time
   
7. Buy a commodity:

   Purchase new commodities or increase your holdings in existing ones
   
9. Processing/refining Commodity:

   Convert raw commodities into value-added products for greater profits
   
11. Sell commodity/product:

   Execute sales transactions to earn from your holdings

This project showcases the practical implementation of:
- Data collection using lists and dictionaries
- Logical operations with conditional statements
- Repetitive tasks using loops
- Modularization with custom functions
- Simulating real-world business logic with simple Python constructs

# Final Notes
This project is part of my portfolio as I continue building expertise in data science and programming. You‚Äôre welcome to explore the code, leave feedback, or share your thoughts!
Terimakasih, and have a great day! üôè
